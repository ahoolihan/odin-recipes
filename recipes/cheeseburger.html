    <h3>Description</h3>
    The below recipe is a delecious cheeseburger made from scratch.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Ground beef</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper</li>
        <li>Olive oil</li>
        <li>Brioche buns</li>
        <li>American burger cheese</li>
        <li>Brown onion</li>
        <li>Ketchup</li>
        <li>American mustard</li>
        <li>Dill pickles</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Method</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Roll the patties in your hands and gently flatten to the right size. They will shrink a little while cooking, so make them slightly larger than the buns. </li>
        <li>Like a perfect steak, burger patties only need to be flipped once. Too much flipping and the meat will dry out and fall apart. Use a little oil on the hotplate and a high heat. Let a crust form on the bottom and then flip. A medium burger will be done in around eight minutes and will have a perfectly crispy shell.</li>
        <li>For the most gooey, deliciously melty cheese, add the cheese to the burger patty in the last few minutes of cooking and let it melt and completely over the patty. </li>
        <li>Place the burger patty covered in melted cheese on top of the brioche bun.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle the chopped brown onion over the top, followed by a layer of sliced pickles.</li>
        <li>Add ketchup and mustard and place the bun over the top. </li>
    </ol>
